      <h2>My life</h2>
      <p>Now you know who I am. But I want to tell you about my life and me a little more specific.
As you know I life in Schwarzenberg. It's a beautiful village in the west of Austria. Here I spend the most time of my life. In Schwarzenberg I also went to primary school before I visited the secondary school in Egg.
My childhood was something very special. Every day I saw my friends, played with them in the afternoons and evenings, spent time with family, but also went to the alps in the summer.
I always had much fun and I couldn't be sad for longer than a day. I'm very thankful for such a great childhood because it isn't that obvious.
I still love living here in Schwarzenberg and I enjoy seeing my family and friends every day.
Now as you also know I visit the Borg in Egg. My goal is to become a vet or a doctor. So the Borg is a nice but also fast way to reach that.
